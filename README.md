# fake-news-detection-using-machine-learning

Fake news on different platforms is spreading widely and is a matter of serious concern, as it causes social wars and permanent breakage of the bonds established among people. A lot of research is already going on focused on the classification of fake news. 

The dataset used in this project consists of thousands of news articles that are labeled as either Fake News or Real News. Each entry in the dataset contains the text of a news article along with a label indicating whether the news is real (1) or fake (0). The dataset is well-balanced, with approximately equal numbers of fake and real news samples, which helps in building an unbiased classification model. The articles cover a wide range of topics and writing styles, making the dataset suitable for training robust machine learning models for fake news detection.

The dataset was originally sourced from open repositories and is formatted as a CSV file. The primary feature used for prediction is the article text, which is processed using Natural Language Processing techniques before being fed into machine learning models. The labeled nature of the dataset enables supervised learning, making it ideal for binary classification tasks.
